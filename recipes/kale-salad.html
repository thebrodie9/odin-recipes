    <h1>Kale Salad</h1>
        <img src="kale-salad.jpg" alt="Kale salad photo">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of romaine! Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein, such as chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending on how much you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
